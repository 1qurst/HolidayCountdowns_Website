            <h2>Overview of Changes</h2>
            <p>We're excited to announce a comprehensive redesign of our website! This redesign is part of our ongoing effort to enhance the quality and accessibility of our content.</p>

            <h3>New Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Navigation:</strong> Streamlined menus and a more intuitive user interface make it easier than ever to find what you need.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Visuals:</strong> We've updated our look with new colors, fonts, and a layout that's easier on the eyes and compatible with various devices and screen sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Load Times:</strong> We've optimized our site's performance to improve page load speeds, making your browsing experience smoother and more enjoyable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Experience Enhancements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Better organized content categories.</li>
                <li>Made the background darker so users aren't blinded whenever they visit the website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Social Icon Bug Fix</h3>
            <p>We fixed a bug with the "Roblox" social icon not appearing. As the background was changed, it was too dark to see the logo. We have now changed it to a lighter logo so you can see it better.</p>

            <h3>New Pages Added</h3>
            <p>We have added a <a href="../../projects">Projects</a> page where you can explore our featured projects. Additionally, we have introduced a <a href="../../contact">Contact</a> page for easier communication.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your continued support as we improve our online presence. We welcome your feedback, so please let us know what you think!</p>
